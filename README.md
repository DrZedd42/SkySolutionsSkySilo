ERC721 token with ERC20 adapter to allow for doping of ERC20 value into ERC721 NON FUNGIABLE unique assets.

SkySolutionsSkySilo, the ```ERC721SmartToken``` contract implements non-fungible tokens based on [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721) standard 
that also supports [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20) interface. The main idea is to create a token that can be both non-fungible and has transferable value. 

Inside ERC721 contract each not fungible token represented as a NFT structure where there is a member element called ```value ```.
```solidity
struct NFT {
        uint256 value;          // NFT value 
        string  metadata;       // ... metadata: IPFS path
        uint256 kind;           // ... type
        uint256 level;          // ... activities level
        uint256 state;          // ... state
    }
```
This element holds ERC20 token inside ERC721 token. 

To work with ERC721 token as normal ERC20 token we need to create a ```ERC20Adapter``` that implements standard ERC20 methods, 
as for example ```balanceOf``` method.
```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256)
```
But in our case due to ERC721 structure for each ```_owner``` there can be many 
non-fungible tokens belong to this particular address. To select particular token for ERC20 compatible operations like 
transfer token value to another address we need to implement new methods that will accept address and token ID as parameters.
```solidity
function approveFrom(uint256 _fromId, address _spender, uint256 _toId, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```
This method calls ```ERC20Controller``` method implemented by ```ERC721SmartToken``` contract that will use the following mappings to store information abount NFT tokens:
```solidity
mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowanceIds; // transfer allowance
mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowanceAmt; // transfer allowance
```
Now we can use ERC20 standard methods ```transfer``` and ```transferFrom``` to transfer values between two NFT tokens.

```ERC20Controller``` implements ```defaultId``` methods that provides a default NFT id for the ```_owner``` address.
```solidity
function defaultId(address _owner) internal returns (uint256 id);
```
So, we can use ERC20 standard method ```approve``` to approve transfer between two NFT default tokens for ```msg.sender``` and ```_spender```.

## TokenContainer 
```TokenContainer``` smart contract implements hierarchical structure for token pools. Now one NFT token can be a container for other NFT tokens in the same smart contract. Each token can belong only one container, ```token-container``` relationship supported by the following mapping:
```solidity
mapping (uint256 => uint256) public tokenIndexToPoolToken;
```
The public variable ```maxLevel``` defines the maximum number of levelels in hierarchical structure where the ```root``` must be al level ```0``` and a token with level ```maxLevel-1``` will be terminal node in the structure.

For each token we can find the path from this token to the ```root``` token using the following method:
```solidity
function getPath(uint256 _nodeId) external view returns(uint256[] path);
```
The ```path``` could contain number of token IDs starting from the first pool token that ```_nodeId``` belongs to. Plase note that NFT ID ```0``` is reserved and equal to ```null``` value. So, only not zeto IDs are counted as pool token IDs.

For each pool token we can check the pool size and recieve pool members array:
```solidity
function _getPoolSize(uint256 _nodeId) view internal returns(uint256 size);
function _getPool(uint256 _nodeId) view internal returns(uint256[] pool);
```
A NFT token can be added to pool token or can be removed from pool. In removal we will check if removing token ```nodeId``` does not have any pool members ```_getPoolSize(_nodeId) == 0``` and if not we will rise an exception.
```solidity
function addToken(uint256 _nodeId, uint256 _parentId) public;
function removeToken(uint256 _nodeId) public;
```
The ```TokenContainer``` constructur calls ```ERC721SmartToken``` constructur with token ```name``` and token ```symbol```.

## TokenPool
```TokenPool``` is ```TokenContainer``` with 4 level pool structure:
```solidity
Level     Container / Member
--------------------------------------------
  0       SuperPool
  1           |_____.Pool
  2                   |_____.SubPool
  3                             |_____.Token
```
The pool schema described by the following structure:
```solidity
struct Pool {
        uint8   level;      // Pool level: 0,1,2,3
        uint256 maxNumber;  // Maximum number of pools on this lavel
        uint256 maxMember;  // Maximum number of members for the pool
        uint256 number;     // Pool number for this level
        uint256 last;       // NFT ID for last availible pool (with member capacity)
        uint256 share;      // Pool share from token investment
 }
 ```
Use ```insertPool``` method to insert token in the pool structure:
```solidity
function insertPool(uint256 _id) public returns(bool);
```
This function calls ```_insertPool``` to insert the token and if needed also insert new pool in the structure:
```solidity
function _insertPool(uint256 _id, uint8 _level) internal returns (bool);
```
After the token is inserted in the pool structure the function ```insertPool``` calls the value distribution function:
```solidity
function _distributeValue(uint256 _id) internal returns (bool);
```
than distrubutes the token value between ```SuperPool```, ```Pool``` and ```SubPool``` based on ```Pool.share```. The rest of the token value after the pool distribution will go to commission. Use the following methods to get collected commission and current pool values:
```solidity
function getComission() public view returns(uint256 commission);
```
```solidity
function getDistribution() public view returns(uint256[4] distribution)
```
The last function returns the following values:
```solidity
distribution[0];         // Super Pool Value
distribution[1];         // Pool Value
distribution[2];         // SubPool Value
distribution[3];         // Tokens Value (must be 0)
```
To pay value the smart contract uses the following function:
```solidity
function _payValue(uint256 _id, uint256 _value) internal returns(uint256[4] distribution);
```
```__payValue``` returns distribution for the payment based on the same structure as ```getDistribution``` but in this case only one array element can have non zero value equal to ```_value```. For example, if Pool has made a payment then ```distribution[1] == _value``` and the rest of ```distribution[0,2,3] == 0```. If all elements have zero value then payment is not successful and all pool does not have enough  value to pay requested amount. In this case ```_payValue``` emits ```SecondTierCall``` event. If the payment went through then event ```PaymentValue``` was emited:
```solidity
 event PaymentValue(uint256 id, uint256 value, uint8 level);
 ```
 and it will return the pool level that has made the payment, in our example it will be ```level == 1```.
